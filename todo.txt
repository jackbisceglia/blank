[ ] implement custom mutators
    + this will enable avoiding ugly permissions and reuse abstractions everywhere but write
    + enables actually iterating on core crud functionality
    + will also scaffold the api layer which lets us do the auth work
[ ] rewrite client data loading to utilize tanstack loaders
    + this will make iteration much easier; stops us from repeatedly opening zero queries everywhere, can just hit context for nested data
[ ] solve dialog pattern
    + need an ergonomic way to easily trigger dialog opens from wherever is allowed. options are:
        a. tie this to the router. this gives us a structure to follow from the start as the router is well defined/typed
        b. lift this to context or atoms/signals. this is super easy and ergonomic, but state doesn't persist, and also makes it much easier to mistakenly open dialogs from places it's not allowed
            i. we also would probably need to tie this into the router anyway, to navigate before open in some cases
